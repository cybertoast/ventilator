Definitions List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BCT
    Breath Cycle Time, Calculated by using 60/(Set Rate)

Triggering
    1   a. Setting when the inhalation starts. Start of TI (Triggers the breath)
        b. Time-Trigger
    2   a. Patiant Trigerring
        b. Patient-Pressure triggering
    2   Patiant Volume
    3   Manual trigerring, based on a que of breaths through a user input


Control Breath


Assisted Breath

Support Breath
    Mechanical breath that is patiant triggered

Variables to Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Variables to Control
    1. TI: Inhilation time
    2. TE: Exhilation time
    3. BCT: Breath control cycle
    4. Pressure Trigger Sensitivity(cmH2O): from -0.5 to -2
    5. Baseline PEEP (cmH2O): from 0 to 20
    6. Pressure Trigger = Baseline - Sensitivity
    7. Volume Trigger Sensitivity (LPM): from 0.5 to 5 
    8. Manual Button: User Input
    9. BPM: Breaths Per Minute
    10. IE Ratio: Inhilation Exhilation ratio, represented as ratio or percentage
    11. VT: Tidal Volume
    12. Peak Flow: Peak Flow Rate
    13. Insperatory flow percentage
    14. End cycling using flow, measured by experation flow sensor

Note: Use default variables based on the previous input
