    A mechanical breath that is patient triggered, volume controlled, and time cycled.

volume control breath
    A mechanical breath that is time triggered, volume controlled, and time cycled.

volume controlling
    A mechanism by which a ventilator regulates inspiratory gas delivery based on the set inspiratory time, tidal volume, and/or inspiratory peak flow.

volume SIMV mode
    A conventional ventilation mode with three breath types: volume control breaths, volume assist breaths, and pressure support breaths. This mode is suitable for all patients if the mandatory rate is appropriately set.

volume support (VS) mode
    An adaptive ventilation mode with one breath type: adaptive support breaths. This mode is suitable for active patients only.

volutrauma
    A complication of mechanical ventilation. Lung injury caused by excessively large tidal volumes.

VTE
    See expiratory tidal volume.

water trap
    A device to drain condensed water from the breathing circuit.

waveform
    A graphical presentation of a monitored parameter over time. A typical example is a pressure waveform.

work of breathing
    The work that is required to overcome the mechanical impedance to respiration. It is the sum of work required to overcome both elastic and air flow resistance.

Wye/Y-piece

A part of the breathing circuit that joins the inspiratory and expiratory limbs. Also called a Y-piece.
